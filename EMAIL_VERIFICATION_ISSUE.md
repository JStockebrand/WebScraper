# Password Reset Email Issue - Root Cause Analysis

## Problem
Users are not receiving password reset emails when using the "Forgot Password" functionality.

## Root Cause
Supabase requires **email verification** before allowing password reset emails to be sent. Users who register through the application but don't verify their email addresses cannot receive password reset instructions.

## Technical Details
- Supabase Auth API returns: `Email address "{email}" is invalid` (status 400)
- This occurs even for registered users if their email is not confirmed
- The issue affects all users regardless of when they registered

## Current Behavior
1. User registers account successfully 
2. User is logged in and can use the application
3. User tries to reset password â†’ Gets "invalid email" error from Supabase
4. No reset email is sent because email is unverified

## Solution Needed
**Option 1: Email Verification Flow (Recommended)**
- Implement email verification during registration
- Require users to verify email before full access
- Only allow password resets for verified users

**Option 2: Alternative Reset Method**
- Implement admin-assisted password resets
- Use alternative authentication method
- Contact support flow for unverified users

## Current Implementation Status
- Error handling improved to provide clearer messaging
- UI updated to inform users about verification requirement
- Backend handles the Supabase error gracefully
- Users get helpful message instead of generic error

## Next Steps Required
1. Implement email verification during registration, OR
2. Set up alternative password reset method for unverified users
3. Consider requiring email verification for enhanced security
