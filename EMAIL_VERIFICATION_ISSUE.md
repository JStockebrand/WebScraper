# Email Verification Timing Issue - URGENT

## ðŸš¨ Critical Issue Identified

**Problem**: Confirmation emails are being scheduled for **August 1, 2025 01:17:30** instead of being sent immediately upon registration.

**Evidence**: Screenshot shows "Confirmation sent at: 2025-08-01 01:17:30.207127+00"

## Root Cause Analysis

This timing issue suggests several possible causes:

### 1. **Timezone Configuration Problem**
- Supabase may be interpreting timestamps incorrectly
- Server timezone vs. database timezone mismatch
- UTC conversion issues

### 2. **Email Queue/Scheduling Misconfiguration**
- Supabase email service may have a scheduling bug
- Rate limiting causing delayed delivery
- SMTP provider queue settings

### 3. **Database Trigger Timing Issues**
- Custom triggers affecting email timing
- Row Level Security policies interfering
- Database constraints causing delays

## Current Impact
- Users register but receive no immediate confirmation email
- Accounts remain unverified indefinitely
- User experience severely compromised
- Registration flow effectively broken

## Immediate Actions Required

1. **Check Supabase Auth Settings**
2. **Verify Email Template Configuration**
3. **Test Registration with Different Timing**
4. **Implement Manual Email Trigger if needed**
5. **Consider Alternative Email Verification Flow**
