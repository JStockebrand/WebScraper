# SUPABASE CONFIGURATION PRIORITY - BEST PRACTICES

## Configuration-First Approach

Based on user feedback, future Supabase issues should be resolved through dashboard configuration changes rather than custom workarounds.

## Recent Success: Email Verification Fix

**Issue**: Email confirmation timing problems
**Previous Approach**: Manual verification endpoints and workarounds
**Better Approach**: Enabled "Confirm email" setting in Supabase Authentication
**Result**: Complete resolution without custom code

## Configuration Areas to Check First

### Authentication Settings
- Email confirmation requirements
- Password requirements
- Session management
- Redirect URLs
- Rate limiting

### Email Templates
- Confirmation email templates
- Password reset templates
- Custom SMTP configuration
- Email delivery settings

### Security Settings
- RLS policies
- API key permissions
- CORS settings
- Domain allowlists

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Investigate Supabase settings** for the reported issue
2. **Test configuration changes** in Supabase dashboard
3. **Document the configuration** that resolves the issue
4. **Only build workarounds** if no configuration solution exists
5. **Clean up workarounds** once proper configuration is found

This approach results in cleaner, more maintainable solutions that leverage Supabase's built-in capabilities rather than custom implementations.
