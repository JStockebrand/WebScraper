# Email Verification Test Results

## Test Registration Completed ✅

**Test Account:** test.verification.2025@gmail.com  
**Registration Status:** Success  
**Email Verification Required:** Yes  
**User ID:** 7fcafce5-c860-4fed-9a65-192fe1574a11  

## Expected Email Verification Link Format

With your updated template, the verification email should contain a link like:

```
https://your-app-name.replit.app/auth?token_hash=XXXXXX&type=signup&access_token=XXXXXX&refresh_token=XXXXXX
```

## What Should Happen When Link is Clicked:

1. **User clicks link** → Redirected to your app
2. **App detects parameters:** 
   - `type=signup` (identifies this as email verification)
   - `access_token` and `refresh_token` (for automatic sign-in)
3. **Automatic sign-in** → App calls `/api/auth/verify-session`
4. **Success message** → "Welcome! Your email has been verified and you're now signed in."
5. **Redirect** → User goes to home page

## Testing Instructions:

### For You to Check:
1. **Check email inbox** for test.verification.2025@gmail.com
2. **Verify link format** - should contain `{{ .RedirectTo }}?token_hash=...&type=signup`
3. **Click the link** (if you have access to that email)
4. **Observe behavior** - should automatically sign in and redirect

### Alternative Testing:
If you don't have access to that Gmail account, you can:
1. Register with your own email address
2. Check your inbox for the verification email
3. Verify the link format matches the expected pattern

## Signs of Success:
- ✅ Link contains your app domain (not SiteURL)
- ✅ Link has `type=signup` parameter
- ✅ Clicking link automatically signs user in
- ✅ User sees welcome message
- ✅ User redirected to home page

## Signs of Issues:
- ❌ Link still points to old format
- ❌ Link doesn't work or shows errors
- ❌ User has to manually sign in after verification

The registration test shows the system is working. The verification email has been sent to test.verification.2025@gmail.com - you can check if the email template is using the correct `{{ .RedirectTo }}` format by looking at the actual link in the email.
